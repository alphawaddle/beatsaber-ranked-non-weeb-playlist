# beatsaber-ranked-non-weeb-playlist
**âš” Beat Saber Playlist - Contains ScoreSaber Ranked songs that are not weeb songs.**

## ðŸŽ¶ The playlist
I've dug through all the [Ranked Songs on ScoreSaber](https://scoresaber.com/), and selected the ones that aren't "weeb".

You can open `*.bplist` files using BeatDrop, and they should be recognized by the game automatically if you place them in `Beat Saber\Playlists`.

## ðŸ¤” What classifies as weeb?
The goal is to add all ranked songs, except the ones that are "weeb". This is a little bit difficult to classify, but I've essentially skipped all the songs that:
- ...have anime for their cover art; *or*
- ...are from an anime or Japanese video game; *or*
- ...when I Google them and weeb stuff shows up.

## ðŸ˜¡ Why are you being mean to weebs?
I'm sorry, but I don't like the majority of ranked songs, and they all seem to have "weeb" in common. The majority of the ranking team seems to be focused on that type of music, and that's fine but it's just not my cup of tea.

I love you all, but I want to play ranked while without hating the music I'm playing. My goal is not to offend anyone. â™¥

## ðŸ˜  You messed up.
Okay, chill. Open an issue or submit a pull request. Thanks.
